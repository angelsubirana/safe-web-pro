## Do you know what they browse with your iOS device?

Safe Web for work is a secure web browser for iOS devices. It is recommended for any business deploying connected iOS devices in order to restrict internet access to only corporate approved websites. This app is a web browser which can block all websites, except those added to the custom whitelist. Internet is restricted on both wifi and cellular data networks.

Default homepage is configurable to your own domain or custom web page in order to restrict access to any place outside your company or whatever the device is showing. It can also be useful for schools, universities, information kiosks, congress stands, hotels, airportsâ€¦ To sum up, to limit what your guest customers and employees browse.

For a more easy and comfortable administration, Safe Web is ready for bulk uploading of websites. It allows the app administrator to massively upload a group of bookmarks all at once. Also, apart from normal websites, specific FTP and HTTPS protocols are supported!
