4.- In the bulk upload screen we have two windows, the one in the left is for website urls and the one in the right is for alias for those websites (this is optional). The accepted formats to introduce the information are these:

- One website/alias per line (as in the next example).
- Or separated by comma ",".
- Or separated by semi-colon ";".

5.- Once the "Execute" button is pressed, the information is loaded. Here we have the whitelist with the new websites.
