<p>Safe Web is a web browser for iPhone and iPad devices. Don’t worry about what your children browse as they will only see what you let them see. Safe Web is a whitelist based Internet browser that only allows to navigate to some predefined websites or domains of your choose. Apart from that, Safe Web creates a sandbox environment where the user can’t leave the bookmarked websites domains. For example: you can allow google.com but they can’t navigate to a search result that is not in the whitelist.</p>

<p>They exist other filtering solutions but they are based on only filtering well known dangerous websites. Don’t trust in this kind of browsers! Hundreds of bad sites appear everyday and they will be filtered in a matter of weeks or months by that kind of apps, meanwhile… your children will be exposed to them.</p>

<h3>With Safe Web it won’t happen again!</h3>
