<h1>What others say</h1>

<p><em>“This is total control and safety. All filters fail you. This does not. 
Enter your beloved URLs and have a friend enter a new (and unknown to you) password. 
This is not just for kids. It’s for anyone who doesn’t want to mess with messing up their lives. THANK YOU!”</em>

<p><em>“This is the only filter that I have seen which can give complete control to parents. 
Kids are only allowed to see websites that have been approved by parents. 
This is so important because kids can get around so many of the other filters that are out there.”</em>
